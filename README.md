## System Docs ðŸ“ƒ
A **Python** code for fitting time-series data with variability, in this case the flux variability of light-curves to extract flux rising and falling times. 
This is a public repository containing the project I developed for fitting the light-curves data points with exponential functions, in order to determine the temporal profiles of the variability. The goodness of the fit is assessed via the normalized Chi-squared of the model and data points.

## Software Requirements ðŸ”Œ
You will need to install the following software on your system in order to run/edit the Python script.
* Mac OS/ Ubuntu 18.04 OS
* Python 3.7
* Textedit/ IDE - spyder or jupyter-notebook
* Python libraries
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib
  * Scipy
  

### About the Data ðŸ’¾ 
The data used https://app.powerbi.com/links/0OSZufb8o9?ctid=8efc1bb9-b90f-4a48-bf6c-ba0686193b80&pbi_source=linkShare. The data comprise of gamma-ray (0.1-300 GeV) integral flux and photon energies from the blazar 3C 279, between February 16 and April 22, 2017. The data was analysed by myself, following standard unbinned likelihood methods, with standard ***Fermi*** science-tools.
