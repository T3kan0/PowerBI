## System Docs 📃
A PowerBI interactive dashboard, showing the summary statistics of the attendance data for a tutorial project between 2018 and 2023. I created this dashboard for a client that needed to keep track of the attendance, as well as the project perfomance and operations across the different years. The user can interact with the dashboard, filter the data using buttoms available on the dashboard, they could filter based on academic years, campus, semester (term), tutorial type (mode of the tutorial), hours tutored, modules tutored, academic faculty (Acad Group) and more.
